# PROJECT
To recreate this game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(card_game)

## DEPENDENCIES
- https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/

## DETAILS
I will start with a tui and later on develop a gui

- In german a round is composed of multiple "Stiche". I'm not sure what to call them in english but so far I have been using "Strikes".

## TODO
- Everything
- I feel like I should delete everything and make it into more of a state machine
